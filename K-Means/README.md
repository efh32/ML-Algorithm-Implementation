How to use?
_______________
The file K_Means.R contains the implementation of the K-Means algorithm.
The file K_Means++.R contains the implementation of the K-Means++ algorithm.
Both files could be run from the command line or in an IDE such as RStudio.

Tests
______________
This folder contains two test files.  K_Means_Test.R tests the K-Means algorithm with two spherical data sets.  
K_Means++_Test.R tests the K-Means++ algorithm with two spherical data sets.  The tests could be run in an IDE
such as RStudio.
